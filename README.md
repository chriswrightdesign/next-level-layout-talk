# next-level-layout
Some of the examples from my next level layout talk given in Smashing Conf Oxford 2016

## Component flow

Technique combining flex-wrapping and css columns so that the component doesn't need media queries

## Progressive grid

How I progressively enhance from CSS Floats -> Flexbox - > CSS Grid

## Auto-sizing

Technique for dealing with multiple items inside of a component

## Equal columns

Technique for allowing you to have equal height columns

## Reverse chronology

A simple technique for displaying a list in reverse to use on something like a twitter feed, comments, or an IRC Chat application

## Source order

Demonstration of basic presentational source order shifting (Read about accessibility concerns: http://tink.uk/flexbox-the-keyboard-navigation-disconnect/). My recommendation is to only use this on presentational elements and things which won't be missed

## Troubleshooting

Some of the interesting things I've come up against in using Flexbox with intrinsic sizing of iframes, SVG, and my workaround for responsive images.
